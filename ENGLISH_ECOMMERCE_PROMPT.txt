### 5. Categories:
```javascript
const categories = [
  { id: "all", name: "All", icon: Grid3X3 },
  { id: "electronics", name: "Electronics", icon: Smartphone },
  { id: "fashion", name: "Fashion", icon: Shirt },
  { id: "home", name: "Home", icon: Home },
  { id: "sports", name: "Sports", icon: Trophy },

];
```

### 6. UI Features:
- Full English language support (LTR)
- Responsive design (Mobile-first)
- Dark/light mode
- Smooth animations
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for alerts

### 7. Important Notes:
- Use 'use client' for components that need interactivity
- Use 'next-themes' for dark/light mode
- Use 'sonner' for toast notifications
- Use 'framer-motion' for animations
- Ensure all components work correctly before adding them to the main page
- Don't add complex components like CartSidebar or Dialog until you've verified they work independently

### 8. Suggested File Structure:
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── globals.css
├── components/
│   ├── ui/ (shadcn/ui components)
│   ├── header.tsx
│   ├── hero.tsx
│   ├── product-card.tsx
│   ├── product-details.tsx
│   ├── filters.tsx
│   └── footer.tsx
├── lib/
│   ├── utils.ts
│   └── stores.ts
└── types/
    └── index.ts
```

### 9. Required Steps:
1. Set up the project and dependencies
2. Build basic components independently
3. Test each component individually
4. Assemble components in the main page
5. Add interactive features (search, filter, sort)
6. Comprehensive website testing

The goal is to create a professional English e-commerce website that's user-friendly and works perfectly on all devices.
